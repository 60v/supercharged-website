# supercharged-website
Here is a copy of the stolen assets world of cars supercharged based their new web revamp on

After al3x went rogue and wanted to dox Ghosty we have decided to open source the primitive website.
We are so sorry to anyone who was effected by al3x's actions and Supercharged is still coming we're working on the revival, and we are making the website from scratch instead of stealing assets. We promise to be more thorough in our decision behind who can lead a project, or be staff, because when it comes to the safety of our users, security is #1. Stay coolant.
